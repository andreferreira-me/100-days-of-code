# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 08/02/2017

**Today's Progress**: I learned about virtualization with Vagrant and VVV (Wordpress). Codetrends.com.br and AndreFerreira.me configured locally and deployed to Shared Hosting on Hostgator with Git and DeployHQ. These projects are already ready for backup and to move to live site.

**Thoughts:** Some errors with VVV. I learned more about the Wordpress database and I gained some practice with Git commands.
