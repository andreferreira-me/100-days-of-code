### Day 3: 27/02/2017

**Today's Progress**: Finish the FreeCodeCamp Challenge "Using the Twitch.tv JSON API".

**Thoughts:** Everything is fine. Mobile first layout, right use of Bootstrap 4. Maybe I should to clean or to refactor the JS code and improve the UX design.

### Day 2: 22/02/2017

**Today's Progress**: Start a new FreeCodeCamp Challenge "Using the Twitch.tv JSON API". Playing with jQuery, API and Bootstrap.

**Thoughts:** Many days without codiing, coding just at work with .NET. I hope start coding everyday since today.

### Day 1: 09/02/2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the "Build a Wikipedia Viewer", a FreeCodeCamp challenge. Playing with jQuery, API and Bootstrap.

**Thoughts:** It was hard to understand the Wikipedia API documentation and I still want to order the results by score or accuracy calling the right Wikipedia API parameters and load a snippet on random article. I also want to improve the frontend for mobile with Boostrap and get the user lang, but it's easier.

### Day 0: 08/02/2017

**Today's Progress**: I learned about virtualization with Vagrant and VVV (Wordpress). Codetrends.com.br and AndreFerreira.me configured locally and deployed to Shared Hosting on Hostgator with Git and DeployHQ. These projects are already ready for backup and to move to live site.

**Thoughts:** Some errors with VVV. I learned more about the Wordpress database and I gained some practice with Git commands.
