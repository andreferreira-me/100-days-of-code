# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 08/02/2017

**Today's Progress**: I learned about virtualization with Vagrant and VVV (Wordpress). Codetrends.com.br and AndreFerreira.me configured locally and deployed to Shared Hosting on Hostgator with Git and DeployHQ. These projects are already ready for backup and to move to live site.

**Thoughts:** Some errors with VVV. I learned more about the Wordpress database and I gained some practice with Git commands.

### Day 1: 09/02/2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the "Build a Wikipedia Viewer", a FreeCodeCamp challenge. Playing with jQuery, API and Bootstrap.

**Thoughts:** It was hard to understand the Wikipedia API documentation and I still want to order the results calling the right Wikipedia API parameters. I also want to improve the frontend for mobile with Boostrap, but it's easier.
